# Targeting Neuroplasticity to Improve Motor Recovery after Stroke: An Artificial Neural Network Model

Using a neural network model of corticospinal motor function, *Norman et al.* show non-normative cortical reorganization and decreased motor function after a simulated stroke and how targeted neural feedback could enhance neuroplasticity, restore cortical organization and improve motor recovery. 

## Setup
The code contained in this repository is confirmed working on a standard installation of MATLAB R2021b. It *should* work on all MATLAB >2016, but has not been tested. 

## Quick start
Simply open `TNP_recovery.m` and run! 

If you have already run models previously, you can use the plot function(s) to load and display results from the data stored in `./results`.
